		<!-- Introduction-->
		<section class="center">
			<p>I'm a design all-rounder who understands both print and digital principles. I create striking user interfaces and intuitive digital experiences and draw from my experience within branding and print to inform my creative decisions. I continuously search for new and keep up to date with industry trends and best practices.<br><br>I have designed for businesses of many shapes and sizes from startups like Fanbookz, small businesses like Maureen Paley, to larger ones such as Unilever and Soho House.

					<h1>Process.</h1>
					<p>
						I take a holistic approach to my work. This helps me understand and create solutions to the task in hand. My process consists of three main stages;
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Definition; Distill the brief, breaking it down into various tasks in an effort to understand the problems and produce a range of solutions.</li>
						<li>Visualisation; Production of low or high fidelity mockups and prototypes, using best UX and design practices.</li>
						<li>Validation; Gathering feedback from stakeholders alongside user research to inform the next iteration of the project.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Cycling through this process allows me to create extensively tested solutions that meet the business and user needs. Once an idea has been validated I take it through to production.
