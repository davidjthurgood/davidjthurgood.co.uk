		<!-- Introduction-->
		<section class="center">
			<h1 id="h1_sent">The internet has come a long way and i’m passionate about taking it even further.</h1>
			<p>I'm a design all-rounder who understands both print and digital principles. While currently focused on creating striking user interfaces and unforgettable digital experiences, I like to draw from my experience in branding and print to inform my creative decisions alongside keeping up to date with industry trends.<br><br>Over the course of my career I’ve been lucky enough to have designed for businesses of many shapes and sizes from startups like Fanbookz, small businesses like Maureen Paley to larger corporations such as Unilever and Soho House.
