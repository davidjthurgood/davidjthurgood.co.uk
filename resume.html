		<!-- Introduction-->
		<section class="center">
			<p>I'm a design all-rounder who understands both print and digital principles. Currently creating striking user interfaces and intuitive digital experiences, I draw from my experience within branding and print to inform my creative decisions. As well as continuously searching for new and keeping up to date with industry trends and best practices.<br><br>Over the course of my career I’ve been lucky enough to have designed for businesses of many shapes and sizes from startups like Fanbookz, small businesses like Maureen Paley to larger ones such as Unilever and Soho House.

					<p>
						Process is important to my craft, I try to take a holistic approach to the projects I undertake. Consisting of three main stages this helps me understand and create solutions to the task in hand.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Definition; Distill the brief, understand the problem and produce a solution</li>
						<li>Visualisation; Production of low or high fidelity mockups and prototypes</li>
						<li>Validation; Gathering feedback from stakeholders alongside user testing</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						This all needs more thought/rewriting
