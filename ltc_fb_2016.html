			<p class="info"><strong class="strong_title">London Theatre Company</strong><br><br>Over the last few months we have been working with London Theatre Company, a new major theatre opening in 2017. After breaking down and researching the brief alongside LTC the ticket selling feature became the highest priority and most important piece of work.  We produced a working prototype of the ticket selling feature and are currently testing it. <br><br>Check out the <strong class="strong"><a href="http://ltc-prototype.staging.withassociates.com/">LTC ticket finder</a></strong> prototype</p>

			<p class="info">We started off by extensively benchmarking competitors and selling platforms. Combined with workshops alongside LTC to understand their business needs and requirements we were able to start producing early wireframes and a strategic plan of action. </p>

		<p class="info">The primary branding work is yet to be complete so our focus was purely on experience and interaction, our primary goal was to create a working prototype with real data that could be used for user research and validation.
